//**** Lambda
//**** Write your answer below

The function bar gives a compile error because of how variable capture works in lambda
functions. Lambda functions capture variables by value, so the variable x is copied into the
lambda function. The lambda function then increments the value of x, but the value of x in the
main function is not changed. The lambda function then returns the value of x, which is 1. The
main function then prints the value of x, which is still 0.
